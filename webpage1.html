  <h2>WHAT MAY AFFECT ONE'S MENTAL HEALTH?</h2>
  <p>Here are some of the most known factors that contribute to the state of our mental health.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li> Childhood Trauma</li>

    alt="Trauma"
    style="float:left;margin-left:20px;margin-right:10px">
    <p style="margin-right: 370px"> Trauma is usually a long-term effect of a horrible life experience. If someone who is as young as a child is exposed to this, it could impact the way they act, think, and cope to their problems when it's triggered. </p>

    <li> Loss of loved one</li>
     <img src="images/grief.jpg" height="150px" width="210px"
    alt="Grief from death of loved one"
    style="float:left;margin-left:20px;margin-right:10px">
    <p style="margin-right: 370px"> Loss of a loved one applies not only to death but also to break-ups, running away of children, or separation from friends. Most people's usual response to this is grief, and it is important to be kind to someone experiencing this because we all work at different paces to move on. </p>

    <li> Bullying</li>

    alt="Highschool bullying"
    style="float:left;margin-left:20px;margin-right:10px">
    <p style="margin-right: 370px"> Bullying involves physical and verbal harm that could affect a person's self-esteem and cause them long-term anxiety. For some cases, bullying is one the reasons why teenagers commit suicide because of severe depression. </p>

    <li> Stress</li>

    alt="Stress from academic workload"
    style="float:left;margin-left:20px;margin-right:10px">
    <p style="margin-right: 370px"> Especially that we are currently in a health crisis, experiencing stress is inescapable but it is completely normal. Some of the cause of stress that contribute to youth today are overload requirements, isolation from peers, family problems and drastic changes in life. </p>

    <li> Substance use</li>

    alt="Susbtance abuse"
    style="float:left;margin-left:20px;margin-right:10px">
    <p style="margin-right: 370px"> Substances such as alcohol, drugs, and cigarettes are commonly used by people as coping mechanisms. Because the brain is the one that gets affected the most, consumption of these substances can change our decision-making and behavior. If someone depends only on this for a long time, then it could make their mental illness much worse. </p>
  </ol>
 <br>
  <h2>MENTAL DISORDERS</h2>
  <p style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px">Mental disorders are serious and common conditions that affect how people function every day. Even though there isn't an exact defined cause for mental illnesses, there are factors such as genes, disruption in brain development, severe trauma, and abuse of substances that could contribute to them. Furthermore, some commonly known results of these factors are anxiety, eating disorders, PTSD, schizophrenia, and ADHD. These can still be treated through methods such as counseling, medication, or regular psychological check-ups. If you have or you know someone that has a mental health problem, always remember that it is not too late to reach out yet. </p>
