          <h2>WHAT IS MENTAL HEALTH?</h2>
          <p style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px">Mental Health refers to a person's condition regarding their emotional,
            social, and psychological well being. According to the World Health
            Organization, it is not simply the just the abscence of various mental illnesses. It's
            all about how we think, feel, and act. Our mental health can change over time. </p>

              <h2>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h2>
              <p style="float-left; margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px">Mental Health is important because it affects the way we
                live daily. Being mentally healthy can help us deal with
                stressful problems, become productive and successful, and have good relationships with other people. It
                can also
                affect our physical health as well.</p>

              <p style="float-left; margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px"> The diagram on the right shows the effects of the
                Covid-19 pandemic on teens. It is classified by how many percent of the boys and girls experienced these
                mental illnesses. From the chart, we can notice that the mental health of teen girls are much more
                affected by the pandemic than the teen boys.</p>

                  <p style="margin-right: 370px"> Trauma is usually a long-term effect of a horrible life experience. If
                    someone who is as young as a child is exposed to this, it could impact the way they act, think, and

                    running away of children, or separation from friends. Most people's usual response to this is grief,
                    and it is important to be kind to someone experiencing this because we all work at different paces
                    to move on. </p>

                    people as coping mechanisms. Because the brain is the one that gets affected the most, consumption
                    of these substances can change our decision-making and behavior. If someone depends only on these
                    for a long time, then it could make their mental illness much worse. </p>

                <!Definition and some examples of mental health disorders>
                  <h2>MENTAL DISORDERS</h2>
                  <p style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 10px">Mental disorders are serious and common conditions that affect
                    how people function every day. Even though there isn't an exact defined cause for mental illnesses,
                    there are factors such as genes, disruption in brain development, severe trauma, and abuse of
                    substances that could contribute to them. Furthermore, some commonly known results of these factors
                    are anxiety, eating disorders, PTSD, schizophrenia, and ADHD. These can still be treated through
                    methods such as counseling, medication, or regular psychological check-ups. If you have or you know
                    someone that has a mental health problem, always remember that it is not too late to reach out yet.
