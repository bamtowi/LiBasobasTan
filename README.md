  <p>"Your Mental Health Helpline" </br></br> DESCRIPTION: ‘How are you?’ This is a question that some people don’t answer with the exact truth because they find it hard to open up about what they are going through. But actually, they just need to find the right person or place that will listen to them and ask the question, "How are you, really?" instead. </br> YourMentalHealthHelpline.com is a website that aims to reach out to those dealing with something in their life and help them overcome it. As the title says, this website can act as your friend, in which you can share messages anonymously, read some tips on what to do when life doesn’t go as planned, and learn about the importance of having a healthy mind and not just a healthy body.</p>
